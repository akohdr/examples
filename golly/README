Stumbled on OpenCL patch in Quartz Composer one day

What else could a geek do but build massive parallel version of Conway life :)
Then obviously you have to feed it a 'Golly' pattern, enjoy......

qtz files are binary unfortunatley, at time of posting this uses:

OSX v10.6.8 (Snow Leopard)
Quartz Composer v4.0 (103.1)

Quartz Composer is/was part of XCode dev tools suite, if it's installed the .qtz association should bring up composer from Finder.

To see simulation run click 'Viewer' button top right of workspace.

To see Shader/OpenCL code highlight 'OpenCL Life Reduced' patch then 'Setting' pane in 'Patch Inspector'


WARNING: this stuff runs up there with Kernel/Hardware tinkering with this stuff is the only time I think I managed to bring down OSX
